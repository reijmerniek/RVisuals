Welcome to RVisuals, a dedicated repository where I showcase a diverse
range of R visualizations that I have created. The primary focus of this
collection is on recreating and refining visuals that I find across the
internet or sharing inspiring visuals I created myself.

This not only presents me with engaging challenges but also provides a
valuable opportunity to learn and discover new R packages and coding
techniques. The idea for this repository came to me when i found a
reddit visual that sparked my interest.

## Reddit Cuisine Visual

The reddit visual that sparked my interest is what I call the ‘Reddit
Cuisine Visual’
<https://www.reddit.com/r/Infographics/comments/17houn9/chart_showing_how_much_or_how_little_a_country/>.
It shows the ranking of cuisines by people from countries. I first
wanted to see if i can recreate it all and then try to use other data to
make use the code I created for the visual. I did this by using data
from the European Championship.

You can find more on this topic in the markdown files within this
repository named Heatmap. See my final result below:
